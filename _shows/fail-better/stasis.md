header:
#  image: /assets/images/stasis/stasis_01.jpg
## header.image: around 1280-1600px is a good width if you arenâ€™t responsively serving up images. Probably shouldn't be very tall - ~320-400px, maybe less..??
## To provide a custom alt tag for screen readers:
#  image_description: "A description of the image"
# header.overlay_image: around 1280-1600px is a good width, and an apect ratio of 3:4 seems to work (for me...)
  overlay_image: /assets/images/stasis/stasis_header.jpg
  caption: "*photographer: Dave Thwaites*"
# header.teaser - should be something like 600px wide - the bottom will get cropped off if more than ~300px(?) tall, as the archive page resizes...

## if we have an header.overlay_image, then we can also use tagline to highlight my production role(s).  Note: can use MarkDown...:
tagline: "Lighting Designer"

This revival of two short plays by Samuel Beckett was the centrepiece of Fail Better's 2009 Beckett Season, honouring the twentieth anniversary of the author's death. A rough and an impromptu formed a unique double-bill, seen in Oxford for the first time in 2009, following performances in 2007 (on the London fringe and at Warwick University).
