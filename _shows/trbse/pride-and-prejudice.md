# header.overlay_image: around 1280-1600px is a good width, and an apect ratio of 3:4 seems to work (for me...)
# header.teaser - should be something like 600px wide - the bottom will get cropped off if more than ~300px(?) tall, as the archive page resizes...

# if we have an header.overlay_image, then we can also use tagline to highlight my production role(s).  Note: can use MarkDown...:
