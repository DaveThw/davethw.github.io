This revival of two short plays by Samuel Beckett was the centrepiece of Fail Better's 2009 Beckett Season, honouring the twentieth anniversary of the author's death. A rough and an impromptu formed a unique double-bill, seen in Oxford for the first time in 2009, following performances in 2007 (on the London fringe and at Warwick University).
