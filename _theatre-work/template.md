## header.image: around 1280-1600px is a good width if you arenâ€™t responsively serving up images. Probably shouldn't be very tall - ~320-400px, maybe less..??

## header.teaser - should be something like 600px wide - the bottom will get cropped off if more than ~300px(?) tall, as the page resizes...
