Following instruction from here: [RaspberryPi.org: Scheduling Tasks With Cron](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/cron.md)

1st, left try installing gnome-schedule, for a graphical interface to set up cron tasks:
```shell
pi@oscbridge:~$ sudo apt-get install gnome-schedule
```
*(takes ~8mins)*

This installs the program, and adds a menu item to the main menu at **System Tools -> Scheduled tasks**.

Having installed it, run the program to set up tasks - for example, to restart Node-RED daily:
- Click Menu -> System Tools -> Scheduled tasks
- Click New
- Choose 'A task that launches recurrently'
- Give the task a description - eg. "Re-start Node-RED"
- Enter the command - eg. `sudo systemctl restart nodered`
- Choose a schedule - eg. Advanced - Minute:0 Hour:7
- Click Add
- Job done!
