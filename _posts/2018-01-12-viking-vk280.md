|          |         |           | **Prism - set index / rotation speed with Prism Index/Rotation channel (15 / 11):** |
|          |         | 20-49     | 6-Facet Linear Prism - Indexing - note: index doesn't always hit exactly the same position (if rotation has been used?)... |
|          |         | 50-75     | 6-Facet Linear Prism - Rotating |
|          |         | 76-104    | 8-Facet Circular Prism - Indexing - note: index doesn't always hit exactly the same position (if rotation has been used?)... |
|          |         |           | *__Note:__ slight difference in the boundary of the ranges here - the manual (for both Viking and Robin units) says 76-**105** / **106**-127, but my experience says 76-**104** / **105**-127!* |

|  15      | 11      |           | **Prism Index / Rotation:** |
|          |         |           | **Prism Index - select prism with Prism channel (14 / 10):** |
|          |         | 0-255     | Index (0 - ~390deg) |
|          |         |           | **Note:** Index doesn't always hit exactly the same position (if rotation has been used?)... |
|          |         |           | **Prism Rotation - select prism with Prism channel (14 / 10):** |
|          |         | 0         | No rotation |
|          |         | 1-127     | Clockwise prism rotation (fast->slow) |
|          |         | 128-129   | No rotation |
|          |         | 130-255   | Counterclockwise prism rotation (slow->fast) |
|  16      | 12      |           | **Frost:** |
|          |         |           | **Note:** This parameter is significant different to the Robin Pointe DMX Protocol |
|          |         | 0-64      | No Frost |
|          |         |           | **Note:** When the frost is activated (DMX 65-255), both gobo wheels return to 'open', and Zoom and Focus **_(and Prism? Shutter??)_** seem to have no effect |
|          |         |           | **Note:** Min Frost is significantly different to No Frost! |
|          |         | 65-255    | Frost: Min (5deg) -> Max (20deg) |
|  17      | 13      | 0-255     | **Zoom:** Max (10deg) -> Min (2.5deg) |
|  18      |         |           | *Blank - might be Zoom Fine, but doesn't seem to function* |
|  19      | 14      | 0-255     | **Focus** |
|  20      |         | 0-255     | **Focus Fine** - Maybe?  It does something, but seems to be a larger effect than changing Focus by 1 DMX point...|
|  21      |         |           | *Blank* |
|  22      | 15      |           | **Shutter/Strobe:** |
|          |         | 0-31      | Shutter closed |
|          |         | 32-63     | Shutter open |
|          |         | 64-95     | Strobe-effect - slow->fast |
|          |         | 96-127    | Shutter open |
|          |         | 128-143   | Closing Pulse in sequences from fast->slow |
|          |         | 144-159   | Opening Pulse in sequences from slow->fast |
|          |         | 160-191   | Shutter open |
|          |         | 192-223   | Random Strobe-effect - slow->fast |
|          |         | 224-255   | Shutter open |
|  23      | 16      | 0-255     | **Dimmer Intensity:** 0%->100% |
|  24      |         |           | *Blank - might be Dimmer Fine, but doesn't seem to function* |
